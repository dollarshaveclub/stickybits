<h1 align="center">StickyBits üç¨</h1>

> Stickybits is a lightweight alternative to `position: sticky` polyfills. It works perfectly for things like sticky headers.

#### Stickybits is awesome because

- it can add a CSS Sticky Class (`.js-is-sticky`) when [position: sticky](http://caniuse.com/#search=sticky) elements become active and a CSS Stuck Class (`.js-is-stuck`) when they become stuck. See [useStickyClasses](#feature).
- it loosely mimics [position: sticky](http://caniuse.com/#search=sticky) to consistently stick elements vertically across multiple platforms
- it does not have the _jumpiness_ that plugins that are built around `position: fixed` have because it tries to support `position: sticky` first.
- in its simplest use case, a `scroll` event listener will not be used if `position: sticky` is supported.
- it is super simple & lightweight
- it provides a [wiki](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits/wiki) that digs deeply into fundementals of `position: sticky` and `position: fixed` and it works with them.

  </p>

----

## Installing from a package manager

yarn

```sh

yarn add stickybits

```

npm

```sh

npm i stickybits

```

## Setup

Add **dist/stickybits.min.js**

Or as a module with `import stickybits from 'stickybits'`

<h2 id="usage">Basic Usage</h2>

```javascript

stickybits('selector');

```

### By default, a selected stickybits element will

- Stick elements to the top of the viewport when scrolled to vertically.
- Stick elements at the bottom of their parent element when scrolled past.

----

**Key Note:** Stickybits expects and works best when the element that will become sticky is wrapped within a parent element that defines when the element starts being sticky and stops being sticky. See below for visual reference.

```html

<main id="some-stickybit-parent">
  <nav id="some-stickybit-nav"></nav>
</main>

```

----

<h2 id="feature"><code>useStickyClasses</code> Feature</h2>

> Stickybits allows customers to add CSS to elements when they become sticky and when they become stuck at the bottom of their parent element.

By default, if `position: sticky` is supported, StickyBits will exit allowing the browser to manage stickiness and avoid adding a `scroll` event listener.

If the `useStickyClasses` argument is set to `true` then even if a browser supports `position: sticky`, StickyBits will still add a `scroll` event listener to [add and remove sticky CSS Classes](#notes). This option is available so that CSS styles can use when StickyBits elements become sticky or stuck at the bottom of their parent.

To provide more feature richness to the Stickybits experience, a `.js-is-sticky--change` CSS class is added after the Stickybit element is sticky for a certain duration of scroll. By default this duration of scrolling is the height of the Stickybit element. The scroll duration for when `.js-is-sticky--change` is added can be modified by providing a number for `customStickyChangeNumber` option.

To use `useStickyClasses`:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {useStickyClasses: true});

```

Then, in css you can do:

```css

.some-sticky-element.js-is-sticky {
  background-color: red;
}
.some-sticky-element.js-is-sticky--change {
  height: 50px;
}
.some-sticky-element.js-is-stuck {
  background-color: green;
}

```

View [add css classes](#notes) for more information on StickyBits CSS Classes.

## Options

### Vertical Layout Position

By default, a StickyBits element will stick to the top of the viewport when vertically scrolled to.

Stickybits loosely works for `bottom` positioning as well.

To have a StickyBits element stick to the `bottom`:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {verticalPosition: 'bottom'});

```

### Custom Scroll Element

By default, if Stickybits uses `window` scrolling to define Sticky Elements. An element besides `window` can be used if `window` is `undefined` by selecting the desired scrolling element with the `scrollEl` option. For more custom sticky featuring, the `scrollEl` option can be used. However, those implementations require the implementing developers support.

To have Stickybit use an selector besides `window`:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {scrollEl: 'an-id'});

```

### StickyBit Sticky Offset

By default, a StickyBits element will have a `0px` sticky layout top offset. This means that the element will stick flush to the top of the viewport.

To have a StickyBits element stick with a `20px` offset to its vertical layout position:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {stickyBitStickyOffset: 20});

```

### StickyBits Cleanup

To _cleanup_ an instance of Stickybits:

```javascript

const stickybitsInstancetoBeCleanedup = stickybits('selector');
stickybitsInstancetoBeCleanedup.cleanup();

```

### StickyBits Update

To _update_ the calculations of an instance of Stickybits:

```javascript

const stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated = stickybits('selector');
stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated.update();

```

Re-calculates each Stickybits instance's offsets (stickyStart, stickyStop).
If the Stickybits implementer would like re-calculate offsets when the DOM window is resized or when the url changes. `.update()` can be invoked within an event listener.

```javascript
const stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated = stickybits('selector');
stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated.update({ stickyBitStickyOffset: 20 });

```

#### More Stickybits Update Examples

```javascript

// when the window is resized
const stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated = stickybits('selector');
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated.update();
});
// when the url hash changes
window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {
  stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated.update();
});

```

**Note:** `.update` does not re-initialize classnames or pre-set calculations. Perhaps the update value can help you with that (see the paragraph below).

#### StickBits Update Props

Props can be updated to each instance by passing then into the `.update` function as an object.

```javascript

// .update({ someProp: somePropValue })
const stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated = stickybits('selector');
stickybitsInstancetoBeUpdated.update({ stickyBitStickyOffset: 20 });

```

### StickyBits NoStyles

To use StickyBits without inline styles except for `position: sticky` or `position: fixed`:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {noStyles: true});

```

### StickyBits Custom CSS Classes

To use custom CSS classes for Stickybits, add the appropriate properties and values.

parentClass:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {parentClass: 'new-parent-classname'});

```

stickyClass:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {stickyClass: 'new-sticky-classname'});

```

stuckClass:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {stuckClass: 'new-stuck-classname'});

```

### StickyBits useFixed

To not use `position: sticky` **ever**, add the following key value to a stickybit initalization.

parentClass:

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {useFixed: true});

```

To change all of the CSS classes

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {
  parentClass: 'new-parent-classname',
  stickyClass: 'new-sticky-classname',
  stuckClass: 'new-stuck-classname',
  stickyChangeClass: 'new-sticky-change-classname'
});

```

### StickyBits useGetBoundingClientRect

To not use `offsetTop` provide the optional boolean `useGetBoundingClientRect`.
This feature is optimal when dealing with things like CSS calc which can throw off `offsetTop` calculations. Read more about this functionality [here](https://stanko.github.io/javascript-get-element-offset/).

```javascript

stickybits('selector', {useGetBoundingClientRect: true});

```

\* For jQuery and Zepto support, read the jQuery notes [below](#jquery).

### StickyBits applyStyle

If you want to take control of how styles and classes are applied to elements
provide a function `applyStyle`. This is useful for example if you want to
integrate with a framework or view library and want to delegate DOM
manipulations to it.

``` javascript
stickybits('selector', {
  applyStyle: ({ classes, styles }, instance) => {
    // Apply styles and classes to your element
  }
});
```

## Notes

### CSS Class Usage

3 CSS classes will be added and removed by Stickybits if `position: sticky` is not supported or if the `useStickyClasses: true` option is added to the plugin call. These Classes can be modified as desired. See the _With Custom Classes_ example above.

-  `js-is-sticky` if the selected element is sticky.
-  `js-is-stuck` if the selected element is stopped at the bottom of its parent.
-  `js-stickybit-parent` so that styles can easily be added to the parent of a Stickybits element

### Not a Polyfill

Stickybits is not a Shim or Polyfill for `position: sticky` because full support would require more code. This plugin makes elements vertically sticky very similarly to `position: fixed` but in a `sticky` sort of way. Read more about position sticky [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) or follow its browser implementation [here](http://caniuse.com/#search=sticky).

Stickybits is a no dependency JavaScript plugin. It provides the smallest API possible in both features and kb size to deliver working sticky elements. This means that opinionated featuring is left out as much as possible and that it works with minimal effort in Frameworks.

### CSS when `position: sticky` is not supported

**Sticky Start and Sticky Stop:** Because Stickybits is minimal, when `position: sticky` is not supported Stickybits will use `position: fixed` which is relative to the browser window. If the StickyBits parent element has a height recognized by the browser, Stickybits will take care of the sticky top and sticky bottom invocation. If the parent's height is not recognized by the browser there will be issues.

**Left and Right Positioning:** With `position: fixed` the Stickybit element will work relative to the browser window by default. To work with this issue, there are several options. Some are noted [here](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits/issues/66). More solutions to come!

### jQuery and Zepto Usage

Basic

```javascript

$('selector').stickybits();

```

With `scrollEl`

```javascript

$('selector').stickybits({scrollEl: '#scrollEl'});

// or

const el = document.querySelector('#scrollEl');
$('selector').stickybits({scrollEl: el});

```

With `.update`

```javascript

const  instance = $('selector').stickybits();
instance.update();

```

With `useStickyClasses`

```javascript

$('selector').stickybits({useStickyClasses: true});

```

With `verticalPosition`

```javascript

$('selector').stickybits({verticalPosition: 'bottom'});

```

With `stickyBitStickyOffset`

```javascript

$('selector').stickybits({stickyBitStickyOffset: 20});

```

## Debugging

Stickybits 2.0 provides the same API but with more debugging feedback.

To view the Stickybits API in it's simpliest form:

```javascript

const  stickybit = stickybits('a selection');
console.log(stickybit);

```

For more debugging and managing Stickybits, view the [wiki](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits/wiki).

----

### Utility properties

Stickybits provides both `version` and `userAgent` properties which were added to offer insight into the browser and Stickybits.

These utility properties can be accessed as direct child properties of the instantiated Stickybits item.

```javascript

const stickybit = stickybits('a selection')
stickybit.version // will show the version of stickybits being used
stickybit.userAgent // will show which userAgent stickybits is detecting

```

## Browser Compatibility

Stickybits works in all modern browsers including Internet Explorer 9 and above. Please file and [issue](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits/issues) with browser compatibility quirks.
